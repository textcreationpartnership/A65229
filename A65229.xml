            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>E that ſhall endeavour to take a <hi>Quaker</hi> off from his conceited bottom, may ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er remove a Material Church from the old Foundation. However one blow at the Root may not be unſerviceable. My pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent deſign is not to trouble this delicate people; to prevent this, I ſhall only give them their own Meat cook't by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their own diſh. It's well known how the Poets were painted of old, licking up what <hi>Homer</hi> did caſt forth. I ſhall only preſent the <hi>Quakers</hi> with that which their over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged <hi>Homers</hi> have diſgorged. I hope this fair dealing can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not juſtly offend any of them. I know it is in vain to tell the <hi>Quakers,</hi> That their <hi>Quakeriſm</hi> is a compound of falſe-Doctrine, newly-brought to light; ſeveral old Errors new vampt; Antichriſtian <hi>Popery</hi> put forth in a new dreſs. The <hi>Quakers,</hi> whoſe Names are ſo and ſo in the fleſh, cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to hear that their falſe ſpirit hath been delivered of ſuch pitiful off-ſpring: However I ſhall endeavour to make their Pamphlets in print tell the Intelligent <hi>Reader</hi> at whoſe doors the <hi>Quakers</hi> pretended ſpirit would have their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable brats laid. It's probable what is written may <hi>movere
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45267:3"/>bilem,</hi> ſtir the <hi>Quakers</hi> choler; but my deſign is only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy that <hi>ſtatus</hi> or windy ſpirit that troubles them, that puts them upon all thoſe irreligious heats with which they and others by them are ſo troubled. To read their <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſtick</hi> follies tranſcribed out of their own Books, may be a proper preſcription for them. Let not the <hi>Quakers,</hi> nor any others believe, that by anſwering fools according to their folly, I do write one ſyllable againſt the Holy Ghoſt, who is God; or that I have ſcoffed the <hi>Quakers</hi> as being the Servants of God; I know very well, <hi>Pietas non patitur lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum:</hi> Give me leave only to tell the Chriſtian <hi>Reader,</hi> That the <hi>Quakers</hi> do commonly beg the queſtion; they take it for granted always, that they only are the People of God, his peculiar ſervants, which is but the true idolizing conceit of themſelves; true humility would make them look upon themſelves with another eye; their ſilly <hi>Quakeriſm</hi> would then be, what it is indeed, a true cauſe of their abaſement before the Lord. To weigh the <hi>Quakers</hi> in the right ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, to take a true eſtimate of them, their Praters are but too like <hi>Baals</hi> Prophets; by their followers that do not know them, they are fondly doted on: <hi>Mahomets</hi> Pidgeon and the <hi>Quakers</hi> Spirit are both alike in this, neither of them are of God. That man is a meer ſtranger to their Scribbles, that knows not what manner of Saints they are in their own Calendar, The People of God, The Seed of God, The Lords anointed ones that muſt not be touched, The Saints of the Moſt High God: Thus like <hi>Simon Magns</hi> they give out that themſelves are ſome great ones, to whom many ſilly people give heed from the leaſt to the greateſt, as if the falſe-inſpired <hi>Quakers</hi> were carried forth by the great power of God. By the way conſider it well, it's a woful miſtake to think or believe, that the <hi>Quaker</hi>'s pretended ſpirit is the ever-bleſſed Spirit, who is God. The vile Doctrines con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the <hi>Quakers</hi> printed Books, are enough to daſh this baſe conceit, this vain belief in pieces. As for my own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45267:3"/>I do look for hard meaſure from my Neighbour-<hi>Quakers</hi> for this kindneſs of love to undeceive them; I have already been ſufficiently, without any juſt cauſe, black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markt by them; A <hi>Judas,</hi> A Perſecutor of Gods people, A black Devil, The Porter of Hell, loaded with all the Plagues of Hell, expoſed to all the Devils of Hell. Theſe are ſome of thoſe unchriſtian evil-ſpeakings which ſome <hi>Quakers</hi> have uſed of me. But I need not tell the Impartial <hi>Reader</hi> how black the <hi>Quakers</hi> mouths are, nor how fell they are againſt any Prieſts; nor how expert they are at dying white black; the greateſt innocency hath not eſcaped their blacking liue. I thank God they are not my Judges, I muſt neither ſtand nor fall before their bar; I am not one jot the worſe for being their filth and off-ſcouring; I am not in the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to retaliate. I ſhall only tranſcribe their own Books to ſerve as a looking-glaſs to let the ſerious <hi>Reader</hi> ſee what baſe Doctrines are broacht againſt God above, againſt the Kings Majeſty below, againſt the Goſpel, the Doctrine which is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter godlineſs, againſt the Scripture which is the Word of God; againſt Jeſus Chriſt, whoſe Satisfaction is denied, whoſe being God-Man is derided, whoſe Perſon is not owned by them. A larger liſt of the <hi>Quakers</hi> baſe Doctrines ſhall be ſummed up in the cloſe of this Diſcourſe, which may not unfitly be called, <hi>The Quakers vain belief, or corrupt Creed.</hi> At preſent I ſhall not wire-draw one line in their Books to ſpeak more than their own words will bear. I ſhall only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeak the <hi>Readers</hi> patience for their very idle diſcourſes; this trouble I cannot avoid. I do before-hand aſſure the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> That his patience will be ſore put to it, to read ſuch impertinent, rude, ignorant, blaſphemous, corrupt, mean ſtuff, fathered on God, who is Truth, in whom is no darkneſs. The Books made uſe of, I ſhall name as I find them named and printed. By theſe Letters <hi>Q. Pr.</hi> the <hi>Reader</hi> will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily know which words are onely taken out of the <hi>Quakers</hi> Books.</p>

After all the fair paint in theſe lines, the Quaker will anon ſhew us his horns; we ſhall ere long know him to be no tame beaſt; before we have done with him, his ill-inſpiring ſpirit will appear; you may certainly expect from this Quaking-Pamphlet, moſt baſe pitiful ſtuff.</p>

                  </label> You ſee how this Quaker takes his Adverſary to task. By the way we may obſerve, that it is plain from the title of this Pamphlet, that this Quaker makes the nature of Chriſtianity to be downright <hi>Socinianiſm.</hi> Here his inſpiring ſpirit appears in print to Socinianize in a groſs manner: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation purchaſed by Chriſt God-man, this Quaker ſaith is explained by his Adverſary in an unſcriptural and nonſenſical ſtile: As the <hi>Socinians</hi> do, ſo this Quaker char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges his Adverſary to write no better ſenſe concerning Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption purchaſed, than to ſay, that God purchaſed of God; an old <hi>Socinian</hi> cavil! Thus the Light within is at unawares ſinging the old Cuckoes ſong. Thus the Quakers <hi>Ignis fatuus,</hi> his pretended ſpirit, hath led him into a <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> pit. Thus the true Chriſtian Religion by this Quaker is brought to a lamentable paſs. According to this Quaking-ſcribble, the nature of Chriſtianity is now aſſerted in the Light to eſtabliſh a baſe <hi>Socinian</hi> Error, as if it were the truth from heaven. What a blind pitiful Elf is the Quakers Light within, that it cannot diſcern Redemption by Chriſt God-man, as a purchaſe made without us, but as unſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and nonſenſical? God the Son made man, purchaſing our redemption of God the Father by the price of his own blood, as God incarnate; This is that bleſſed Truth explained, which this <hi>Socinian-Quaker</hi> calls unſcriptural and nonſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal. However this point ſearched to the bottom, toucheth the Quakers to the quick. They cannot endure to hear of Chriſt God-man; the Son of God purchaſing of God the Father, leans towards the Doctrine of the Trinity, which the Quaker <hi>E.T.</hi> termed in mine and others hearing a blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous doctrine.</p>

If this be true, then where is, or what is become of this Quakers true Chriſtianity? If this, with his fellow-Quakers, were enjoined by the Kings Majeſty, the Defender of the true Faith, to ſubſcribe to the 39 Articles of Religion, then by their thus declaring their unfeigned aſſent and conſent but to the two firſt Articles thereof, their falſe Chriſtian paint would ſoon fall off; then the Kings Majeſty would ſoon ſee what manner of Chriſtians theſe Saints, Seed, People (as they call themſelves) of the Moſt High God are.</p>

That man is a ſtranger to the point of Juſtification, that knows not, that many Scriptures have been wreſted by the Papiſts for this purpoſe, which have been ſoundly vindicated from Popiſh gloſſes put upon them. This <hi>Quaker</hi> doth but <hi>actum agere,</hi> act the Popiſh old part over again, to amuſe unwary Chriſtians with the rehearſal of them. If this Quakers ſpirit were of God, he had ere this been ſilent in this matter. To uſe this Quakers own words, I ſhall tell him, That it is an old Popiſh trick to aſſert Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification by works of the Spirit, from miſtaken Scriptures; and there is certainly no little ſpice of the old Law-work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirit in it.</p>

Thus Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus the Son of <hi>Mary</hi> ſitting on Gods right hand in Heaven, is no article of this Quakers faith. 5ly, Chriſt the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> is no outward bodily exiſtent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon without us, diſtinct from God; to hold Chriſt our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to be a diſtinct perſon from God the Father, is no part of this Quakers faith. The light within guides no Quakers to own this great Goſpel-truth; their ſpirit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires none of them to be ſound in this doctrine of faith; <hi>Light of Light, very God of very God,</hi> is none of their faith. 6ly, Chriſt the Saviour, the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> is not to be worſhipped as God. Mind it well, the Hypoſtatical Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:45267:16"/>on is not owned by any Quaker; becauſe the Quakers do deny our Saviour to be God man in one perſon, therefore they deny that the Son of <hi>Mary</hi> is to be worſhipped as God. 7ly, That Chriſt the Saviour, the Son of <hi>Mary</hi> is outwardly bodily glorified at Gods right hand, is no Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-truth. Laſtly, to call <hi>Mary</hi> the Mother of God, is a Popiſh ſaying, which to be ſure is not Scripture-language; in this Quaking diſcourſe the learned may obſerve many old Hereſies revived, however by this Quakers golden Calf the nature of true Chriſtianity is made naked, it is ſtript off its primitive glory; it may now truly be called <hi>Ichabod,</hi> for by this Quakers moſt ugly doctrine, the glory is departed from it.</p>

As for the Sacrament of the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:45267:24"/>Lords-Supper, there is in this Quakers eye no ſuch thing; for the body and blood of Chriſt is, as he tells us, the true meat and drink, but bread and wine in the Lords-Supper are not ſo; theſe things, <hi>i. e.</hi> baptiſm, bread and wine (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this Quakers mind) are falſe things, not to be regarded by true Chriſtians, who live in the ſpirit; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſenſe of this Quaking-father, all Quakers are thoſe true Chriſtians, who do ſo live in the ſpirit, as that they are above Baptiſm and the Lords Supper; theſe are thoſe falſe things which are not regarded by them; may it not be truly ſaid, Alas poor deſpiſed Church of <hi>England!</hi> how low art thou fallen? What's become of thy two Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments which are generally neceſſary to ſalvation? Art thou now beholding to the Popes invention for them? How are Chriſts own Ordinances now made to be the Popes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices? In baptizing and receiving the Lords Supper, what is the whole practice, but according to the Popes inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Did thine Husband, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, ever or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain Baptiſm and the Lords Supper, ſo as thou uſeſt them? Why doſt thou receive bread and wine according to Chriſts inſtitution? did he ever ordain bread and wine to be ſo u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and received? Doſt thou not know that the wine in the Cup is another of the Popes inventions? Doſt thou not conſider, that Baptiſm and the Lords Supper are two falſhoods?

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:45267:27"/>chief Magiſtrate, the Fountain of Honour, there's by the Quakers no true outward honour due. But ſuppoſe the King (as he hath juſt cauſe) ſhould be offended with his Quaking-ſubjects, or any of his Courtiers, for not giving him both hat- and knee-honour, which are due to him; were it not better to give the King the honour, than offend him? In this caſe, what muſt be done? According to this Quaking-Inſtructor, all his Quaking-friends, and all Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers (if they ſhould be Quakerized) muſt be careful that they run not into tranſgreſſion by ſuch reaſoning: for to honour the King with their hats, with their knees, is reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his perſon, to whom no honour is due; a ſin which the Law of God will convince them of; like this Quakers Child, what muſt they now do? Therefore (to uſe this Quakers words) that they may not offend the King, they muſt mind the Lord and his Teachings: Is it not hence plain, that to honour the King with either hat or knee-ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, is neither of the Lord, not that which is taught by him? Now conſider well what is done daily at Court; the Kings Majeſty is outwardly honoured by all Courtiers; what ſaith the Quaker to this? By giving the King that outward honour, his Courtiers do neither mind the Lord, nor his teachings: I am ſure this is the naked ſubſtance, the true import of his diſcourſe. To ſtep on, to track this Quaker a little further; Look upon the King (as he is) as Gods Vice-gerent, the Supreme Magiſtrate of this Kingdom, who doth expect that all his ſubjects ſhould acknowledg his high ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, their own great diſtance, with heads bare, with knees bowing in his preſence; then mind what curſed doctrine is delivered by this quaking-father, thus, <hi>But the wo ſhall be to that in them which would be honoured by the hat;</hi> according to this Quakers curſed doctrine, the King, the Nobility, with all that are in Authority under him, are accurſed by this Quaker for taking that outward honour that belongs not to them; as for outward honour to be given to the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:45267:27"/>King, or any other Magiſtrates, this Quaker is baſely bold to ſay, it is more than the Lord requires; this is that which mans proud heart ſeeks after: Are not the Kings ſubjects by this Quaker, ill principled, taught here to deny outward honour to the Kings Majeſty, as if the Kings high honour were none of the Lords requirings? in a Quakers mouth, <hi>Charles how is it? Let Charles live:</hi> Plain <hi>Charles</hi> is honour enough for the King; what is more, cometh of evil; for this Quaker ſaith, the Lord requires no outward honour to be given to Magiſtrates; and I am ſure, of theſe the King is chief: To back this unchriſtian doctrine, this Quakers ſpirit hath a lye put into his pen, for the Lord doth no where require that we ſhould honour all men in him; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is this to give honour to whom it is due, as this Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker doth ill underſtand this point. Beſides, this quaking-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is groſly miſtaken; for <hi>dominium non fundatur in gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> it's not true grace that doth intitle any Princes only to their Crowns and Scepters. <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that was no truly gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious man, was King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and the Lords anointed. King <hi>Darius</hi> an heathen, was owned and honoured by <hi>Daniel.</hi> But this Quaker hath not yet done; here's more lamentable bad doctrine againſt the Lords anointed; I hope I may write without offence, that here are Treaſon and Rebellion taught againſt our Soveraign; according to the tenour of his own words, you may take this ſuppoſition: Suppoſe the King were a proud, heady, high-minded man, what then? in this caſe what is to be done? This Quaker ſaith, there is no honour due to him, though he be great in the world, and be in place to rule. Is it not plain, according to this quaking-doctrine, that without goodneſs there is no true honour due to the Kings greatneſs? nay, behold more of this abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtuff! here is the power of God mentioned by this Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, in which power enjoyed or lived in, the poor is as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable as the rich, and the beggar as he that rules: accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the true meaning of this Quakers words, the Kings
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:45267:28"/>high honour is baſely degraded, his Majeſty is ranked with the meaneſt of his ſubjects, that is a Quaker, one that is in the power of God: for, unleſs that this Quakers power of God be in the King; or more plainly thus, unleſs the King be a Quaker, the beggar-Quaker is as honourable as himſelf; and the reaſon of this Levelling-Quakers vile doctrine is this, <hi>for the honour is given as due unto the power, and not to any mans perſon;</hi> is it not plain from this wild reaſon, that there is no true honour due to the Kings perſon at all? But ſuppoſe the power of God (as this Quaker cants) were in the King, what would be got by it? he would not be one jot better than the meaneſt dry or wet Quaker; the pooreſt Quaker in the ſame power of God, would be as honourable as his Soveraign that rules: Surely this wretchedly baſe doctrine is not fit to be told in <hi>Gath,</hi> nor publiſhed in <hi>Aſhkelon;</hi> the greater is the ſhame of Quakeriſm, that it ſhould be publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our Valley of Viſion; this Quakers doctrine tends directly to nothing more, than to lay the Kings honour in the duſt, to ſtrike the Crown from his Majeſty's head, and to ſhare with the King in his high honour; it may be truly ſaid, Beware of Quakers; for like the Jeſuited Papiſts, they are not in truth the Kings Loyal ſubjects.</p>

                  </label> In theſe lines this quaking-father is teaching his Scholar an odd new language; here his quaking-ſpirit is turned <hi>Grammarian,</hi> after his quaking-faſhion to teach lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle children to ſpeak properly; to give [Thou] to one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and no more; but [You] to more than one; [Thou] is become the Quakers <hi>Shibboleth,</hi> to diſtinguiſh them from all others; it's in truth a main principle of the Quakers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion, diſtinctly to character them from all whom they count counterfeit Chriſtians; by them great ſtreſs is laid upon this word [Thou], it's no leſs than a language with this Quaker; like <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Ladder, it's made by them to reach to Heaven; they are all from below, that do not uſe [Thou] to a ſingle perſon; probably at the confuſion of languages [Thou] is the true language, which is fallen to the <hi>Babel</hi>-quakers ſhare; this Quaker tells us, that they who uſe not [Thou] to a ſingle perſon, are none of them guided by the ſpirit of God; to mount this Quakers folly to its full height, to ſay to the King, <hi>May it pleaſe your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,</hi> to any Peer of the Realm, <hi>Your Grace, Your Honour;</hi> to any great man, <hi>Your Excellency;</hi> to others, <hi>Your Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip;</hi> theſe are according to this Quaker, ſuch expreſſions of civil honour as were never ſpoken by any holy men of God; I may truly ſay, that [Thou] like <hi>Moſes</hi> his Rod hath ſwallowed up all theſe Serpentine words; they (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at Court or Country) who do not uſe this Quakers [Thou] to a ſingle perſon, (whether King, Peer, or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject) are ſenſual, not having that ſpirit of truth, who leads into all truth; without [Thou <hi>Charles</hi>] to the Kings Sacred Majeſty, without [Thou] to every Peer of this Realm with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpect, the language of truth (ſaith this Quaker) is
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:45267:29"/>not in that mans mouth; that man that is not a Thou and Thee-quaker, is not taught by the ſpirit of truth; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this Quakers mind, when we do ſpeak one to one, we muſt beware of [You] to one another, for all they that do uſe [You] to the King, to the Nobility, to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates and Gentry of this Kingdom, do in this thing not mind the Spirit of God and its teachings. This Quaker ſaith moreover, that to uſe [You] to any one man, is that falſe word brought forth by the Devil, the falſe ſpirit act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them that uſe it; nay, which is worſe, [You] to a ſingle perſon, is the apoſtate language; now is not this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference rightly drawn from his own words, to ſay to the King, <hi>Your Majeſty;</hi> to the Peers, <hi>Your Grace, your Honour;</hi> to others, <hi>Your Worſhip;</hi> are no leſs than falſe words brought forth by the Devil; no leſs than an apoſtate lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage? Thus you ſee that this word [Thou] is ſo doted on by this Quaker, as that for its ſake all that uſe [You] inſtead of it, to a ſingle perſon, do ſpeak as the Devil, the falſe ſpirit acts them; they are all apoſtates, ſuch as are faln from the true Chriſtian faith; to give full weight, they are all proud like <hi>Lucifer,</hi> who have [You] ſeated in the pride of their hearts; may it not be truly ſaid, this Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers ſpirit is both bold and blind, who durſt write after this ſilly rate?</p>

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:45267:30"/>in the manner of truth, that do give civil honour to their ſuperiors; this rude Quakers diſcourſe ſerves to be-clown all Courtiers that do honour the King in their words and geſtures; for in effect this Quaker tells them that they do not ſpeak in the manner of truth, thoſe good and true words which are mannerly words; they neither know the teachings of God, nor the truth of God, which is far worſe. Thus you ſee that here is the Quakers School, their rude Court to learn thoſe manners which are in the manner of truth; as for our civil way of ſpeaking to our ſuperiors, betters and equals, by being thus mannerly, we do but ſeek to honour others in the falſe ſpirit, who is the Devil; if this Doctrine do not tend to make men Clowns, to re-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize them into the Quakers falſe ſpirit, to make their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes as errant Clowns as themſelves are known to be, then let any wiſe men judg.</p>

                  </label> In this rambling diſcourſe this Quakers drift is to inform his Scholar about Oaths; but his Light within is ſo groſly dark, as that lawful and unlawful ſwearing are altogether confuſed and condemned alike by him; all ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring indifferently is condemned by this Quaker as that ſin which reacheth to damnation in hell; according to the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of his quaking-lines, all the Kings ſubjects who have taken the Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance, have done that which the Lord forbids them, that which is contrary to what Chriſt hath commanded them; by thus ſwearing they have not minded the ſpirit of truth, nor ſo loved the Lord Jeſus as to keep his Commandments, by ſhewing their obedience to the King; in taking the foreſaid Oaths they have tranſgreſſed againſt the Lord Jeſus Chriſt the King of Kings; by taking theſe Oaths they have done that which comes of evil, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:45267:31"/>ſhewed to Jeſus Chriſt? for in ſo doing they have broken his Commandments; by thus ſwearing they have preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly tranſgreſſed againſt him; which of the Kings ſworn ſubjects have minded the Spirit of truth when they took thoſe oaths? By their ſo ſwearing, have they not done that which comes of evil, or of the Devil, the evil one? Is not this rare quaking-ſtuff? according to this Quakers falſe doctrine, it is altogether unlawful for any of the Kings ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to ſwear ſubjection to him any more, leſt they fall into condemnation; as for any oaths which are truly lawful, they are ſo condemned by this Quaker, as that there is no Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-warrant for them in this day; to plead Scripture for thoſe oaths that are in truth, righteouſneſs, and judgment, it's like uſing an old Almanack out of date; it may well be ſaid, To what end did St. <hi>Paul</hi> tell the Chriſtian <hi>Hebrews</hi> of God ſwearing by himſelf, and that an oath is to put an end to all ſtrife? for had this Quaker been in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> time, he would have catechized him otherwiſe, that he did not underſtand the Scriptures; that St. <hi>Paul</hi> had taught other doctrine than the Lord Jeſus had done, for he faith, <hi>Swear not at all; but let your yea be yea:</hi> That ſolemn oaths are as bad now as vain oaths: That ſwearing was lawful under the old diſpenſation, but unlawful now: Then St. <hi>Paul</hi> might have known this new-light-doctrine, That Chriſt ended the diſpenſation of oaths where ſtrife was.

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:45267:32"/>martyred: doth not this Quakers ignorance, in effect, count all Holy-days to be Apoſtatical days? Are not theſe the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtival days which his Child is inſtructed to abominate the obſerving of? What is more plain from theſe Quakers words, than this, That Holy-days obſerved by the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Churches abroad, and the Church of <hi>England</hi> at home, are abominable days, not fit to be obſerved? But why are Holy-days to be abominated? This Quaker gives this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Becauſe they were ſet in the blood-thirſty ſpirit; it's hard to underſtand the meaning of theſe words; however we have no Holy-days which this Church obſerves, but ſuch as were at firſt ſet up by a blood-thirſty ſpirit; ſurely if this Quaker had lived in thoſe days of old, he would have faln as ſtrangely foul upon the <hi>Jews</hi> Feaſt of <hi>Purim,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from another blood-thirſty ſpirit; but this Quakers aking-tooth is at the Lords-day, or Sabbath-day; in this matter the Prophane and the Quakers are well agreed, they do neither of them make conſcience to obſerve this day to the Lord; for that called the <hi>Lords-day,</hi> or Sabbath-day, this Quaker ſaith, that the people do not well underſtand what they ſay; to ſpeak according to this Quakers own words, both King and Parliament were faln low in their underſtandings, when they made an act for the better ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the <hi>Lords-day;</hi> in their debates they ſaid they knew not what, who named it either <hi>Sunday, Lords-day,</hi> or <hi>Sabbath-day;</hi> had this Quaker been conſulted, they might have known thus much, that the ſeventh-day-Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath is ended in Chriſt; that the <hi>Lords-day</hi> is the firſt day of the week; that <hi>Sunday</hi> is from the Heathens, but in truth every day is the <hi>Lords-day;</hi> ſo that to declare this Quakers mind truly, there is indeed no ſuch day as the <hi>Lords-day</hi> to be obſerved by any Chriſtians, for every day of the week is to be obſerved as the <hi>Lords-day;</hi> and this is not this Quakers ſingle opinion, for he ſaith, that they who come to Chriſt, and believe in Chriſt, do (which is

Now from this Quakers lines let us ſee their down-fall; according to this Quaker, the laſt end of all the aforeſaid perſons, without exception, is to be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ever; for, as he ſaith, though they are as high as the Heavens, neſted like the <hi>Edomites</hi> among the Stars, yet this Quakers pretended Lord, (not the Lord God) will fetch them thence; this Quakers falſe Lord will caſt them into
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:45267:38"/>hell, like <hi>Lucifer, Dives, Haman, Pharaoh, Herod,</hi> and the reſt of their forefathers; according to the true import of this quaking-ſcribble, all that are called Lords, Ladies, Knights, Gentlemen and Gentlewomen, Maſter, Miſtris, Madam, ſhall every one of them, unleſs they turn Quakers, be damned for ever; you ſee that they are ſaid by this Quaker to be all alike wicked and accurſed, like <hi>Lucifer, Dives, Haman, Pharaoh,</hi> and <hi>Herod,</hi> and the reſt of their wicked, miſerable forefathers, they ſhall without any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception be all caſt into hell.

Behold, now neither King, nor Peers, nor Knights, nor any other Gentlemen in this Kingdom, are to be honoured, becauſe they want the Quakers ſeed of God, which is noble, which is born up to rule; according to this abominable doctrine, any Peaſant-Quaker is more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable than the Kings Sacred Majeſty; more noble, more gentile, than all the Nobles and Gentlemen of this whole Kingdom; behold, how the abject Quakers are ſtrangely over-valued beyond their true worth; like the Prophets of God, who were Noblemen and Gentlemen, ſprung from the Noble ſeed (not Quakers ſure), like Chriſt ſprung of the Noble ſeed (oh abominable! that he ſhould be a Quaker too!) like the Noble Apoſtles, ſprung of the Noble ſeed (oh ſtrange, that theſe ſhould be Quakers too!) ſo are all Quakers noble, who are ſprung of the ſame noble ſeed; now whether doth this baſe high-flown doctrine tend? is not this the ſcurvy reſult of it? in compariſon of any, or of all the Quakers within this Kingdom, the Kings Majeſty, the Nobles, the Dignities of this Realm are of no true worth; in compariſon of Quakeriſm, all ſuperiority, maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, excellency, nobility, honour, gentility, breeding, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, do ſtand for ſo many cyphers, they are all nothing worth, for this Quaker ſaith, the true honour is no more after the fleſh; it's well known that the Kings of <hi>England</hi> are born heirs of the Crown, but this Quaker is boldly baſe to ſay in print, that there is no honour belongs to them that are born after the fleſh; how plain is it that the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers do acknowledg no honour to belong to the Royal blood, to any Peers or Gentlemen? according to this baſe Quakers doctrine, are they not made as mean, as baſe as any Country-peaſant? for true honour, as this Quaker rants it, is no more after the fleſh; thus you ſee how all ſuperiority, nobility and gentility are cried down by this Quaker, that the Quakers may be the only noble, or men
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:45267:49"/>of true honour, which to ſpeak the truth is a proud devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh deſign; but to go on ſtill with this Quaker, he calls giving and receiving civil honour, that which is earthly and outſide honour; which is a baſe reproach to the Kings high honour, which is both given and received; but as for them who give, who receive this civil honour, he ſaith, they are in the unbelief; behold, according to this abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable teaching, both the Courtiers who give, and the King who receives honour, are no better Chriſtians than <hi>Turks, Jews</hi> and Infidels, they are in the unbelief; they are out of the Doctrine of Chriſt, they do by their cringing and bowing, honour and exalt the devil, they do (what this Quaker means, I know not) worſhip the beaſt and his image; if this be not high baſe doctrine delivered by this Quaker againſt all ſuperiority, nobility, honour and gentility, then let all wiſe men judg; now let us ſtep on to ſee what this Quaker means by manners, breeding, courteſie and civility; the account given by him is this, <hi>Do as you would be done by; ſpeak every one truth to his neighbour; let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, for evil communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion corrupts good manners; let your yea be yea, and your nay, nay, for what is more is evil;</hi> he ſaith here is manners, bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, courteſie and civility; and further he tells us, that the right noble Quakers have theſe manners; but the ſting of this Quaker is yet behind, for (he ſaith) that the nobles and great ones of the earth want theſe manners and this breeding, and ſo do both Prieſts and people of all ſorts; you may in this Quakers glaſs ſee that all the nobles and great ones, the Prieſts and people of this Kingdom are a ſort of unmannerly clowns; they are all in this Quakers account ill-mannered and ill-bred; I need not review what this Quaker calls manners and breeding, courteſie and civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; let it be remembred that he ſaid, the nobles and great ones, the Prieſts and people of all ſorts want them, which is to beclown the whole Kingdom; but now we are brought
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:45267:49"/>by this Quaker to the time that now is, that before the right noble ſeed in the Quakers, the Kings and Nobles of the earth ſhall be bound in chains and fetters of iron; do not theſe words ſmell ſtrong of a religious rebellion? with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt theſe words do look as if they had been blown out of <hi>Sheba</hi> his Trumpet; I may truly ſay, they have no little wild-fire in them; our Superiors do well know that this Kingdom hath ſadly ſuffered by perverted places of Scripture; when the Quakers begin to talk of binding Kings and Nobles in chains and fetters of iron, the alarm is given; by this Quaker, here is a further account given of the nobility, gentility, ſuperiority, honour, breeding, manners of the world, he ſaith, it is all after the fleſh; it is likewiſe ſprung from proud <hi>Lucifer,</hi> who is the devil; as for all Nobles, Gentlemen, Superiours, perſons of Honour, breeding, manners, they are (ſaith this Quaker) baſtards, who we know are baſe born; to ſpeak his mind, they are all inferiour to the noble Quakers, none of them are ſprung from the noble gentile ſeed, as the deluded Quakers are; to all theſe, or any of them, no honour is due; thus in this Quakers account, they are no better than the ſcum of the world; for this reaſon (as this Quaker tells us) no noble-born Quakers can bow to them; for if they ſhould (what then? it follows thus) we ſhould ſet the devil in the room of God; behold, it is hence very clear, that (according to this baſe quaking-doctrine) to honour the King, or any Nobles, or Superiours, or Gentlemen, with that honour which is due to them, is to ſet the devil in the room of God; from this fore-going evidence, it is fully manifeſt that the Quakers (who are noble in their own eyes) are baſely deſtructive, by their rude doctrine to the Kings Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, to all ſuperiority, nobility and honour, to all genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, breeding, and manners of this Kingdom; and that the Quakers do not give unto <hi>Caeſar</hi> the things that are <hi>Caeſars,</hi> nor that fear to whom fear, or that honour to whom ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is due.</p>

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:45267:55"/>to in this life, is (as this Quaker doth baſely ſpeak) a great deluſion of the devil, to keep people in ſin; <hi>pag.</hi> 98. <hi>He that ſaith he hath no ſin, deceiveth himſelf, and is a lyar;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold what this bold Quaker ſaith to this! what ſaith he? he ſaith, this is no other but a Scripture brought by the devil; but obſerve him a little further; he ſaith, that the devil tells men, that Chriſt died for all; that if they lay hold on him by faith, their ſins ſhall not be imputed to them, though they ſin daily; <hi>that the righteous man ſins ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven times a day;</hi> that all the holy men of God ſinned; that the devil doth thus take Scripture to maintain his Kingdom; and that this is that doctrine which the devil delivers by the mouth of his Miniſters; behold, how Goſpel-truths are by this Quaker ſaid to be told men by the devil, and how Gods Miniſters are ſaid by him to be the devils mouth in deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the foreſaid truths! except Quakers, who dare affirm it, that all thoſe Miniſters of the Goſpel are the devils mouth, in ſaying, that Chriſt died for all; that their ſins ſhall not be imputed to them that believe in Chriſt, though they ſin daily; that the righteous man doth ſin often in one day; that the holy men of God have ſinned; that do deny a perfect freedom from all ſin attainable in this life? But now let us obſerve what this Quaker ſaith further, to teach that there is moſt certainly no quaking freedom from ſin in this world, this is (according to this Quaker) that doctrine whereby the devil carries on people in an eaſie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightſome way to the fleſh; a doctrine which heals them up in their ſins with a feigned faith; a doctrine which ſettles them on the lees; a doctrine which ſets up a reſt in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils Kingdom; a doctrine which deſtroys all tenderneſs of Conſcience; to ſpeak this Quakers mind, without being perfectly cleanſed from all ſin, no man can witneſs Chriſt to be his Redeemer, nor witneſs that he is come to deſtroy the works of the devil; nor can he witneſs that Chriſt is come to redeem him (which are his own words) out of the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:45267:55"/>fall, and out of the devils Kingdom; it's no marvel that the Quakers do ignorantly plead for a perfect freedom from all ſin in this life, for this is their top-gallant errour, which makes them (as this Quaker ſaith) to reign like Kings, above the world, death, hell and the devil; which makes them (I may more truly ſay) miſerably proud, in their own eyes no leſs holy and happy than Chriſt himſelf is; without this haughty, over-holy dotage of this Quaker, all other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are of no account; they are, ſaith this Quaker, ſuch whoſe eyes are outward, they do look at a Redeemer afar off, ſtill living in ſin; by this quaking doctrine of Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, this Quaker ſaith, <hi>pag.</hi> 101, That the children of God and the children of the devil are made manifeſt; behold, in this Quakers account they are manifeſtly the children of the devil, who do not hold a perfect freedom from all ſin on earth; thus this idolized Perfection of the Quakers ſerves to unchriſtian all but themſelves; according to this Quaker the faith of all Chriſtians is vain, and their hope is no better; their faith is the faith of all hypocrites, no true faith in God, if they do not own a quaking-perfection; as for St. <hi>Paul,</hi> this Quaker tells us untruly, that he did wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs this perfect freedom from all ſin, that this was his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more than a conquerour; ſurely this Quaker never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. in vain doth this Quaker tell us, that they who dwell in the righteouſneſs of Chriſt ſin not, for the Scripture records no ſuch over-holy inhabitants; it's true, it's the devil who pleads for ſin, and let that mans mouth be ſtopt for ever that doth ſo; but to affirm the in-being and dwelling of ſin in the beſt of men in this world, is no ſiding with the devil in the ſame plea; but this Quaker hath laid a foul load on thoſe Miniſters of the Goſpel, who teach that none can be perfectly cleanſed from all ſin in this life; he ſaith to this purpoſe like the Sadduces, they do all err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God; they do deny the end of Chriſts coming; they bring ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:45267:56"/>doctrine, a doctrine which they have from their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the devil; they are deceivers, who creep into ſteeple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes, and lead ſilly people captive; but this Quaker is miſtaken, for St. <hi>Paul</hi> never ſaid ſo; <hi>pag.</hi> 103. he ſaith, they are ſuch teachers as are accurſed; they are daubers with untempered mortar; ſuch ſeers as ſee vanity; ſuch as divine lyes; ſuch as heal the hurt of the people ſlightly; ſuch as ſow pillows under their arm-holes; ſuch as ſooth people up in a falſe peace; ſuch as make the people to take up their habitation in ſin as long as they live; ſuch leaders as cauſe them to err; the utter enemies of their ſouls; ſuch as perſwade their hearts in ſins; now give me leave with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offence to ſay, oh quaking-perfection from all ſin in this life! oh brain-ſick whimſie! to what extravagant aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to what deviliſh expreſſions, to what foul aſperſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons haſt thou tranſported this poor deluded Quaker? let all wiſe unquakerized perſons judg, if this quaking-error can be that unbottoming doctrine which declares our faith to be feigned, our Prieſts to be lyars, deceivers, antichriſts, ſuch in whom the falſe Prophet rules; ſurely becauſe this Quaker was not rightly inſtructed to diſtinguiſh well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the being and ruling power of ſin, therefore the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures have been ſorely tortured to ſpeak what he would have them, in favour of his falſe doctrine; hence, I hope, was the true riſe of this Quakers groſs miſtakes, baſe aſſertions, and foul charges; but I have done with this Pamphlet, not for want of more pitiful matter, but becauſe I haſten to the next Pamphlet of this <hi>James Parnel,</hi> called, <hi>The Watcher;</hi> it's a conceited Title, in it the baſeneſs of Quakeriſm is drawn to the life, but I ſhall not dwell upon it; I ſhall only tranſcribe ſo much as may ſerve to lay open the Quakers pitiful teachings; you will ſoon perceive that this <hi>Watcher</hi> is none of the watch-men of the true <hi>Iſrael.</hi>

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:45267:58"/>by this Quaker to be a pitiful piece of Chriſtianity; as for the Scripture (this Quaker ſaith) that was the Letter whereof theſe called Chriſtians were the keepers, which they took for their rule; according to this Quakers mind the Scripture hath been the miſtaken rule of all Chriſtians to walk by, ever ſince the Apoſtles days; as for any Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries written upon the Scriptures ſince the Apoſtles days (this Quaker ſaith) they were but their own meanings and imaginations; behold how all Expoſitors of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures both ancient and modern are baſely aſperſt by this Quaker! their Expoſitions have been no more but their own meanings and imaginations obtruded on the Scripture. As for Infant-baptiſm uſed in all ages of the Chriſtian Church (this Quaker like an <hi>Anabaptiſt</hi> ſaith) there is no Scripture nor example for it; that it is in vain called an Ordinance of Chriſt; then, (ſaith this Quaker) that is in the reign of Antichriſt, they had their two Sacraments, but without any Scripture-warrant for the word <hi>Sacraments;</hi> as for the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, this Quaker calls it only carnal bread and wine; thus in the reign of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt (this Quaker ſaith) the Church was planted in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and other places; behold, according to this Quaker, both the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and other particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches planted ſince the Apoſtles days in any part of the world, are all under the dominion of Antichriſt; their bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm with water is no Ordinance of Chriſt; the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is only carnal bread and wine; both Sacraments with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Scripture-warrant; but mark what follows, Then (that is, in the reign of Antichriſt, in the long time of cruel darkneſs, in the time of the Lords abſence from the earth) were (as this Quaker ſaith) Biſhops ſet up, and Archbiſhops, Deans, Prieſts, Deacons, Popes; the Biſhops bearing rule by their Means, Prieſts preaching for hire: Behold, how this Quaker gives us a diſtinct ſound of the Antichriſtian Hierarchy, which hath continued ſince the Apoſtles dayes!

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:45267:59"/>hypocrites; then (that is in the reign of Antichriſt) began (to ſpeak this Quakers mind) the Eccleſiaſticall thieves, who ſtole the Apoſtles words (as the falſe Prophets did) who took a verſe, and ſtudied from it a divination of their own brain; juſt as the Prieſts do now, they run like the falſe Prophets; (according to this Quaker) ever ſince the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles days, all Gods Prieſts have been thieves like the falſe Prophets, preaching a divination of their own brain; like falſe Prophets running without God ſending them; then (that is in the reign of Antichriſt) thorough covetouſneſs, they made merchandize of the people with feigned words; like wolves upon ſheep, they preyed upon the people; they ſought about for great livings, for fat benefices; they ran from a leſſer to a bigger living, the beloved which they ſought for; like the falſe Prophets they ſought for the fleece, not regarding the flock; they cried peace to them that put into their mouths; they prepared war, ſued, law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe that did not feed them; thus they ſought their gain from their quarter, and ruled like tyrants with rigor; (according to this Quakers mind) you ſee that ſince the Apoſtles days all Prieſts in the Chriſtian Church have been baſely covetous; vile cheats; bloody wolves; ſordidly ſelf-ſeeking; minding the fleece more than the ſheep; like the falſe Prophets; greedily ſeeking their gain from their quarter; ruling like tyrants with rigor; thus (according to this Quaker) our Prieſts old fathers planted their Church, and ſo ſet every thing in form and tradition, according to their own imaginations; behold, ſince the Apoſtles days (to ſpeak this Quakers mind fully) there hath been no Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church, but ſuch as was planted by the old fathers of our Prieſts, and this Church was planted by them after the worſt faſhion, according to their own imaginations; that we may not miſtake this Quaker, he tells us plainly, his particular thoughts of our own Church, ſaying, here is the ground and foundation of the Faith and Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>

                  </label> Theſe lines of this quaking <hi>Biſhop</hi> are abominable; not to point at every baſe paſſage in them, this is plainly the mind of this wild <hi>inſpirado,</hi> that the judgment of God (to uſe his own words) hath taken hold on <hi>Charles Stuart,</hi>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:45267:74"/>and his Children, and his party; that the Lord hath made the King, his Children, his party, a dreadful example of his vengeance; and that <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi>'s ſword was the Lords inſtrument of this judgment, and of the vengeance executed on the late King and his Children, and his party; that I may not be looked upon as a bloody Prieſt, I ſhall ſqueeze theſe lines no further; only let me ſay without offence, that no man of any common ſenſe dare juſtifie what this Quaker hath written to be the moving of Gods ſpirit; without queſtion theſe are ſuch traytorous lines as were never ſeen in print from the eternal God before.</p>

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:45267:75"/>the Name of God to be blaſphemed and evil ſpoken of; they obſerve months, and days, and conſecrated places; their preaching is limited to days, hours, and hour-glaſſes, and to the wills of men, to outward obſervations, traditions, and ceremonies; by their fruits theſe trees may be known; out of the evil treaſure of their hearts, they bring forth evil things; they are an ill ſavour; clouds that hold no water; they are ſounding-braſs and tinkling cymbals; they do not profit the people at all; being weighed, they are ſtill found too light; they do neither believe nor underſtand what they preach; they have no experience of the word of life; like thoſe ſilly women, they are always learning, but never able to come to the knowledg of the truth; they flee the croſs; they are not willing to forſake all for Chriſt; they chuſe rather to be ſubject to the corrupt laws and wills of men, than to obey Chriſt in denying themſelves; they lay heavy burthens on mens ſhoulders, which they touch not with one of their fingers; they have reſpect to their intereſt, profit, eaſe, ſecurity; they count gain godlineſs; they are preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and ſetters up of tythes, which Chriſt came to put an end to, with the law; they ſue men at law for them; they are hirelings, who do falſly apply Chriſts words to themſelves, <hi>The labourer is worthy of his hire;</hi> tythes are only claimed by falſe Teachers; they deny the doctrine of Chriſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning every one with a ſaving-light [and that truly, for it is a quaking-falſhood); they deny the manifeſtation of the Spirit in all; they reproach the true Miniſters of the Light [and juſtly, becauſe of their folly]; they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors of the children of light [but the Quakers have no truth nor righteouſneſs to be perſecuted for]; they deny that any are made perfect from all ſin in this life [which they ought to deny]; they preach up the power and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of the devil's leading into ſin, above the power of Chriſt over ſin in this life; they exalt their Maſter the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils power above Chriſt, who came to overcome the Devil;

                  </label> In this quaking Author we find that they are the pretended Miniſters of Chriſt; that they are Antichriſts Miniſters; that the Goſpel preached by them is the Goſpel of Antichriſts ſetting up; that they are led by the ſpirit of Antichriſt; that they make merchandize of the words of God; that they are not Miniſters of the Spirit; hypocrites, who do in words draw nigh to Chriſt, but deny him in their works; that <hi>Epiſcopal, Presbyterian</hi> and <hi>Independent</hi> Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers are alike corrupt; they do all preach in their own wiſdom of words; they do differ from the true Miniſters of Chriſt, his Goſpel and life; that they all want a thorough-reformation; that they have taken up their ſtations in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities; that they are rejected of God; ſuch from whom the Lord is departed; ſuch as are denied of the Lord to be his Miniſters; to them the Lord (as this Quaker pretends) ſaith, <hi>Who hath required theſe things of your hands, wherein
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:45267:76"/>you have polluted my name?</hi> they ſeek their own, more than Gods; they have not the Spirit; they are turned aſide to fables; they are quenchers of the Spirit; they are deſpiſers of Propheſie; they ſpeak evil of that they underſtand not; they are none of Chriſts Miniſters in the Spirit; they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert not any unto God; they go forth in the will of man; they are not of God; they are falſe ſhepherds; they ſpeak their own words; they compoſe their Sermons in their own wills and wiſdom; they are no true guides in the way of life; they are deceivers and Seducers, who wax worſe and worſe; they run in the way of <hi>Balaam;</hi> they are the falſe guides who lead to deſtruction, whoſe ways are the ways of death, whoſe end is everlaſting miſery; who are ready to blaſpheme that holy name whereby the Quakers (but in pretence and falſely) are called.</p>
               <p>I may without juſt offence to any ſay, That I have truly ſet down from his own words this Quakers baſe account of all the Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> for the moſt part this is done in this Scribblers own words; if not ſo, then in the genuine ſenſe of his own words; when I am put to the teſt, this will be found true. As for this and the other quaking Pamphlets, I can truly ſay, <hi>hiſce oculis vidi, hiſce manibus tractavi;</hi> obſerve but the time when their Books conſulted by me were Printed, and then this truth will be evident.</p>
               <p>To their Books I ſhall inſtead of an <hi>Index,</hi> add an <hi>Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix,</hi> which the Reader may be pleaſed to look upon, as <hi>The Quakers unſound faith,</hi> which I ſhall be bold to ſet down as the Quakers Belief, becauſe in that Book of theirs called, <hi>Truths defence,</hi> they do boldly ſay, <hi>pag.</hi> 104, That they are moved by the immediate Spirit of Chriſt to write or to put in print; That their papers or printed Books are from the immediate Eternal Spirit of God. The Articles of the Quakers faith will be ſupernumerary, above twice four and twenty; I ſhall ſet them down with reference to what
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:45267:76"/>hath in the foregoing diſcourſe been taken out of their own Books; all this I ſhall do either in their own words, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the true meaning of them. By the letter <hi>Q.</hi> is meant <hi>Quakers.</hi> To begin with <hi>their unſound faith.</hi>

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:45267:93"/>leading into ſin, above the power of Chriſt over ſin in this life; that they do exalt the devils power, who is their maſter, above Chriſt; that they preach up outward worſhip, bodily ſervice, outward forms, ceremonies and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervances of outward ordinances and traditions of men, of worſhip in outward Temples, and conſecrated places, and outward conformity, out of the life and power of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, in Common-prayer, ſervice, and ſinging of <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalms; that they pleaſe themſelves with an outward me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lody of voice and organs; that they labour to bring peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to an outward communion, under an outward profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and name of Chriſtians; that they make them Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans by an outward waſhing; that their fellowſhip is only in and with the world; that they do not what God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires at their hands; that they are preachers up of the Kingdom of the Beaſt and falſe Prophet; that they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailers of the great City <hi>Babylon;</hi> that their trade and merchandize do depend on her; that they are pretended Miniſters of Chriſt; that they are Antichriſts Miniſters; that the Goſpel preached by them is of Antichriſts ſetting up; that they are led by the ſpirit of Antichriſt; that they make merchandize of the words of God; that they are not Miniſters of the Spirit; that they are hypocrites, who draw near to Chriſt with their mouths, but deny him in their works; that <hi>Epiſcopal, Presbyterian</hi> and <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi> are alike corrupt teachers; that they do all preach in their own wiſdom of words; that they do differ from the true Miniſters of Chriſt, his Goſpel and life; that they do all want a thorough-reformation; that they have taken up their ſtations in formalities; that they are rejected of God; that they are ſuch from whom the Lord is departed; that they are denied of the Lord to be his Miniſters; that they are ſuch teachers to whom (as our friend <hi>Knight</hi> ſaith) the Lord ſaith, <hi>who hath required theſe things at your hands,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:45267:93"/>wherein you have polluted my name?</hi> that they ſeek their own more than Gods; that they have not the Spirit; that they are turned aſide to fables; that they are quenchers of the Spirit; that they are deſpiſers of Propheſie; that they do ſpeak evil of that which they underſtand not; that they are none of Chriſts Miniſters in the Spirit; that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert not any unto God; that they go forth in the will of man; that they are not of God; that they are falſe ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds; that they ſpeak their own words; that they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their own Sermons in their own wills and wiſdom; that they are no true guides in the way of life; that they are deceivers and ſeducers, who wax worſe and worſe; that they run in the way of <hi>Balaam;</hi> that they are falſe guides, who lead to deſtruction, whoſe ways are the ways of death, whoſe end is everlaſting miſery; that they are ready to blaſpheme that holy name whereby we Quakers are called.
